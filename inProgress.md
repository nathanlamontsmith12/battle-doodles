Each player takes turns picking their doodles, each of which has a unique ability and a different set of stats. (For more info, click the DOODLE DESCRIPTIONS button below)

Then, each player's doodles duke it out in the arena.  The goal is to KO all of your opponent's doodles.

Player 1: press A key to attack, D key to block 
Player 2: press J key to attack, L key to block

After inputting an attack, there will be a short delay before you can attack again. So make every attack count!

Inputting an attack when your attack dot is at least halfway in the red zone  will damage your oppononent. The amount of damage goes up with  your doodle's strength, and the speed of your attack dot -- a faster  dot makes it more difficult to land a successful attack, but you will do a lot more damage! The speed of your dot for each attack is randomly determined. 

If the dot is more than halfway outside the red when you attack, you will miss -- that is, you deal zero damage. A miss also results in a longer delay before you can attack again.

If your dot is entirely within the red zone when you attack, you score a perfect hit, which deals double damage.

 When you see the shield icon, that means you are under attack. Hit the block button ONCE to reduce the incoming damage, but beware: Hitting the block key when the shield icon is not displayed will damage your own doodle, by an amount equal to its "BlockHurt" stat.
